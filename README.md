# bpy_create_IK_smush
simple script to setup IK on imported smash ultimate skeletons. Useful because smash skeletons have rotated bones along the Shoulder-Elbow-Hand or Hip-Knee-Foot chains, which would break a conventional IK setup.

To use:
Don't install this script. Just run it from the 'Scripting' tab in blender. Make sure the smash skeleton is selected!

Known Issues:

Some smash ultimate skeletons have a perfectly aligned Shoulder-Elbow-Hand or Hip-Knee-Foot chain. For these skeletons, you will need to create a slight bend by modifying the newly created 'EXO bones' in edit mode youself.
