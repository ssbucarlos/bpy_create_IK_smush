# bpy_create_IK_smush
simple script to setup IK on imported smash ultimate skeletons

Known Issues:

Some smash ultimate skeletons have a perfectly aligned Shoulder-Elbow-Hand or Hip-Knee-Foot chain. For these skeletons, you will need to create a slight bend by modifying the newly created 'EXO bones' in edit mode youself.
