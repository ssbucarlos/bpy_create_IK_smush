# bpy_create_IK_smush
simple script to setup IK on imported smash ultimate skeletons. Useful because smash skeletons have rotated bones along the Shoulder-Elbow-Hand or Hip-Knee-Foot chains, which would break a conventional IK setup. The goal of this script is to setup IK without modifying the existing smash skeleton, in order to allow import + export of animations

To use:
Don't install this script. Just run it from the 'Scripting' tab in blender. Make sure the smash skeleton is selected!

Features:
Arm + Leg IK controllers, animations created with these IK handles are able to be exported back into smash!


Planned Features:
For the list of currently planned features, check out the 'issues' page. Please feel free to leave feature requests, especially if its a feature that makes your life animating alot easier!
